# Armada
This repository shows how I would code in production. These are some parts of the projects I have been working on as a freelance.
I am fully authorized to show the client code here on GitHub with the limitation that I have to remove assets altogether along with server code.

## Explanation.
- This project doesn't use Singleton as you would expect. Instead, it uses Service Locator pattern a lot.
